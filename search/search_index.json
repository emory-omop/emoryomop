Sex assigned at birth is not guaranteed, but is often used for many Emory research projects outside of OMOP without further assessment of the sex vs. gender coding confirmation.</li> <li>Best Practice Guidelines: <ul> <li>Use the <code>gender_concept_id</code> field in the <code>person</code> table with this known limitation in mind that it could represent either sex assigned at birth or gender identity, or transitioned gender.

Aggregation across the primary key in a particular table may sometimes be required, as there are a great many changes to data in an EHR system that are not relevant to how data is represented in the OMOP-CDM. For example, a patient's drug order may have been ordered by one clinician, modified by the pharmacist, cancelled by staff by mistake, and then re-added by the pharmacist as they go to fulfil the order in the EHR. For operational purposes, these types of data are critical to capture, but for research questions we'll be addressing with the OMOP CDM, we are only interested in the final state of the drug order. _source_primary_key_source The exect location where the _source_primary_key was obtained. This should be nearly machine readable, with the caveate being aggregations.

For example, if the source primary key is a minimum value of the <code>_source_primary_key_soure</code> column in the table, it will be represented as <code>database.table.column^min()</code>.

The Enterprise OMOP group has attempted to identify the most common source values in the CDW data for ingested source data, and has thus far used the common medical ontologies housed in Epic to map Epic data as of this product release stage (see top of document). We have certainly missed importat items for certain researchers in the CDW data, as well as a lot of medical terms not associated with a common medical ontology in Epic.

You will want to begin to approach the task at the level you are most familiar with the data. For example, if you are a clinician working in hyperspace, finding the data in Epic, and getting us the INI number for the particular data element you are looking for will make collaborative work FAR easier (holding shift on your keyboard, and then clicking on an item with the left mouse button will give you critical details about the data element)! We can pull and provide you with a breakdown of the most common concepts and you can help us identify which of those you care most about. Alternatively, being able to create a SlicerDicer dashboard containing the concepts you are interested in is another great first step! In turn, if you are an analyst, using slicer dicer, or finding the element in Clarity Data Dictionary or Reporting Workbench associated with ZC tables or other places to find a list of concepts you care about, will similarly be your first approach.</p> <p>You are always welcome to reach out to us, at any time, but unfortunately our time is quite limited.

The Enterprise OMOP group has attempted to identify the most common tables and columns from Epic that will need to be in the CDM for this product release stage (see top of document), but we are certain we've missed data that is critical to end user needs.

Before approaching the next steps in the SOP process, you or a member of your team may wish to review critical data elements in an attempt to find a marker of where that type of data is located in the source system, and keep notes so that you are prepared to share those markers with the enterprise OMOP team (more on that later). You will want to begin to approach the task at the level you are most familiar with the data. For example, if you are a clinician working in hyperspace, finding the data in Epic, and getting us the INI number for the particular data element you are looking for will make collaborative work FAR easier (holding shift on your keyboard, and then clicking on an item with the left mouse button will give you critical details about the data element)! Alternatively, being able to create a SlicerDicer dashboard with the data you are interested in is another great first step! In turn, if you are an analyst, using slicer dicer, or finding the element in Clarity Data Dictionary or Reporting Workbench, will similarly be your first approach.</p> <p>You are always welcome to reach out to us, at any time, but unfortunately our time is quite limited.

Alternatively, they utilize expert consensus in the particular fields of medicine to create the mappings and identify the vocabularies that are the coordinated \"standard\" vocabulary. If issues with a mapping are identified via pressure testing by the global community of OMOP implementers, these may lead to a community remapping effort (typically discussed as logged github issues, discussion in the forums, or efforts of a particular workgroup to improve the ontology of interest to their work).
