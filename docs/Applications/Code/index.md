## Programming Languages and Tools

Users may develop against Emory's OMOP-CDM with any tool that can access our data lake(s) at Emory. However, the following are common languages used by the OHDSI community, and/or used locally to interact with our data.

-   :simple-r: __R and RStudio__

    ---

    R is a programming language and free software environment used for statistical computing and graphics. RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. Together, they provide a powerful platform for data analysis and visualization. Historically, R has been the preferred language of OHDSI developers, and much of the ready-made tooling is available in R.

    SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language specifically for managing and manipulating relational databases. It is widely used for querying and updating data in the OMOP-CDM.
