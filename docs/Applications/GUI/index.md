    The OHDSI ATLAS application is a web-based tool for designing and executing population-level analyses on large-scale observational health databases. It attempts to provide a user-friendly interface for researchers to define their study populations, specify their analysis parameters, and visualize the results. However, it can be challenging to get started! Please see the following for assistance.

    The Data Quality Dashboard is a web-based tool for assessing the quality of observational health data. It provides a user-friendly interface for researchers to explore the quality of data in an OMOP instance. Though typically a shiny application, Emory has developed a static version that contains the five most recent dashboards, for the five most recent releases of our OMOP data.

    CohortDiagnostics is an OHDSI tool for evaluating the performance of cohort definitions. It provides a set of standardized analyses to assess the characteristics and outcomes of the target population defined by a cohort.

    The OHDSI Phenotype Library is a repository of standardized phenotype definitions that can be used for observational research. It aims to facilitate the sharing and reuse of phenotype definitions across different studies and institutions.

    Emory intends to implement a local version that will track the phenotypes our community has developed locally, along with the CohortDiagnostics associated with each submitted cohorts.
