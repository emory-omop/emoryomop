# Overview

The Emory Enterprise OMOP Primers are meant to supplement the official docuementation of the data model and conventions provided by the OHDSI community. In order to ensure Emory is adhering to the principles of the CDM as an easy starting point for federated research in network studies around the globe, conventions created for the primary CDM tables, fields, and vocabularies by the OHDSI community **will not be modified**. However, there may be specific **additions** made to make things easier for the Emory user community (e.g., data provenance and in-depth PII data for re-identification across sources).

Our site's Primers are organized into categories that match the standardized categories in the following CDM diagram:
