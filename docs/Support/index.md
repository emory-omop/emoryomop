# Defined Support Workflows

The following workflows are recommended for the most expedient support:

<div class="grid cards grid-2" markdown>

-   :octicons-bug-16:{ .lg .middle } __Report a Bug__ 

    ---
    
    The best way to report a bug without follow-up questions from support is to:

    * Describe the issue you're experiencing
    * Include steps to reproduce the issue
    * Provide any relevant screenshots or error messages
    
    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Bug Report Form](https://emoryrhsit.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/OMOPRP/form/203)


-   :octicons-sparkles-fill-16:{ .lg .middle } __Request a Feature__  

    ---

    If you have a feature request, please provide the following information:

    * A clear description of the feature you would like to see
    * The problem this feature would solve
    * Any relevant use cases or examples

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Feature Request Form](https://emoryrhsit.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/OMOPRP/form/204)


-   :material-earth:{ .lg .middle } __Request Access to an OMOP Resource__  

    ---

    If you need access to an OMOP resource, you will need to complete a request via REDCap. Specific documented workflows at present:

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Request ATLAS Access](Access Requests/ATLAS/index.md)

    :octicons-arrow-right-24: Request Database Access (Under Construction)
