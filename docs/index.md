# Emory Enterprise OMOP

## 🏥 What is OMOP?  
The **Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP-CDM)** is a global standard for organizing healthcare data.  
It provides a consistent framework that allows researchers, clinicians, and analysts to work with structured clinical information across time, systems, and institutions.

## 🩺 Why Emory Uses OMOP  
At Emory, our mission is to advance research and improve patient outcomes through high-quality, standardized data.  
By leveraging OMOP-CDM, we can:  

- 🔄 **Standardize** data from multiple EHR systems such as **Epic** and **Cerner**  
- 🤝 **Collaborate** seamlessly with partners and other institutions  
- 📊 **Generate real-world evidence (RWE)** to drive clinical insights  
- 🌍 **Contribute** to the global **OHDSI** research network

## 🚀 Getting Started  
Whether you’re a **researcher**, **analyst**, or simply curious about our work, this site is your starting point for exploring Emory’s OMOP ecosystem. Use the menu on your left (or hidden by :material-menu:) to get started! We recommend beginning with the OMOP Primers, particularly if you're unfamiliar with OMOP, but are quite familiar with data in an EHR.
