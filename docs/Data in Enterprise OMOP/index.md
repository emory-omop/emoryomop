# Overview

Our data have undergone significant changes over the years, as well as significant mapping and infrastructure improvements. These efforts in the ***what*** of our data are organized as:

1. **Realeses**: both with regard to code, and to our jira issues tackled
2. **Data Mapping**: the mapping of data from our EHR systems to standard targets
    - This section is divided into current concept coverage, the top 10 concepts occurring within a concept column, and finally a custom concept SOP for community contributions
3. **Data quality results**: This section discusses both data quality tests along with pass/fail status, as well as remaining known issues for our release
